# You found [me](https://kevinrwhitley.com)!

Hi!  I'm an obsessive technologist with 25 years (~16 professional) of programming experience, specializing in user experience (UX) and developer experience (DX, which is really just another form of UX), and streamlining dev teams by identifying and removing development/execution bottlenecks.

### COMMUNITY
I've been actively engaged in the JavaScript tech community for over 10 years, with downloads of my open-source NPM libraries exceeding a few million per year (~60-70k/week as of Sept 2022). Beyond that, I work closely with the teams of leading PaaS providers (e.g. Cloudflare) to help pioneer an easier, more elegant development experience for developers around the world. By simplifying complexities for everyone, I help enable rapid idea execution... ultimately shortening the time between conception and delivery (for myself as well as others).

Along these lines, my published works center around a single premise: achieve more, with less effort. I believe code that's simple, human-readable, and *short* is the best code. Put simply, your future self (or any new developer) will have to waste less time trying to interpret/understand it. Boilerplate code is the noise we have to sift through to derive meaning from code. I target that.

### TEAMS
In addition to my open source contributions and build-in-public projects, I specifically love working with teams in an architecture/advisory/mentorship role. I love finding and cultivating passion in developers, and fostering that exciting positive-energy culture of nerding out, idea-sharing, tech-exploration, etc. ends up benefiting *every* employer, big or small.

### PRODUCTS
Just check out any of my public projects (listed in profile), but needless to say, I obsess around delivering a fantastic, lightweight user experience. Additionally, the last several years have focused on ensuring ultra-high read throughput and minimal worldwide latency for consumer apps, reducing both initial paint and interaction latency.

### PREFERRED TECH STACK
I have rather strong opinions about which client frameworks and API delivery patterns companies should be using, usually with the goals of "infinite scaling worldwide, with minimal/zero effort, low cost, and less/no DevOps overhead). 

For instance, while most companies are presently still choosing React, I believe it's in a sunsetting phase and may no longer be the best choice for new applications. Likewise, if your DevOps team is suggesting to containerize everything into Kubernetes clusters, you may be wasting a *lot* of time/money in your current platform architecture... let's chat!
